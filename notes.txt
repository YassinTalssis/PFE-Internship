###########################Automatic Chemical Design Using a Data Driven Continuous Representation of Molecules##############################



The objectif in this paper is to generate new molecule with a specific 	chemical properties

the model has 3 companante:
Encoder: onverts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector take smiles as input(knowen as latent space representation)
	+Technicall implementation: The encoder can be implemented using a neural network, typically a series of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The output of the encoder is the continuous vector representation of the input molecule.
Decoder: onverts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations
	+ Like the encoder, the decoder can be implemented using neural network layers, possibly with a symmetrical architecture to the encoder.

The predictor:estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule
		+ The predictor can be implemented as a separate neural network or as part of the overall architecture.
		+ The output of the predictor could be various chemical properties such as solubility, toxicity, bioactivity, etc.
		+ The predictor network is trained to predict these properties based on the latent representation of the molecule.



the question here is we can identify a mof:

			+ the characteristic hat reamins constant for a given MOF:
				* Chemical Composition
				* Topological Structure
				* Unit Cell Parameters
				* Crystal Symmetry
				* Coordination Environmment of Metal Nodes
				* Porosity and Surface Area
				* Thermal Stability
				* Optical Properties
			+ other characterisic:
				* Targeted Pore Size and Shipe
				* High surface area
				* Chemical Stability
				* Tunable Functionality
				* Scalability and Synthesis Feasibility
